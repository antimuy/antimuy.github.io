# Anti-MUY!
MUY! is a franchise owning company whose CEO has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help re-elect Trump. They own numerous fast food franchises around the country.

When the company began to recieve a lot of attention for the CEO's donations, they removed their locations page, making it redirect to the home page. This is assuredly to prevent these locations from being targeted by people justifiably angry they are helping support a fascist government.

This is a backup of that page.
